# Deep Neural Networks From Scratch

This is an implementation of deep neural networks using nothing but Python and NumPy. I've taken up this project to complement the [Deep Learning Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/deep-learning), offered by Coursera and taught by Andrew Ng.

Currently, the following things are supported:

- Layers:
  - `Dense`
  - `Conv2D`
  - `DepthwiseConv2D`
  - `SeparableConv2D`
  - `Conv2DTranspose`
  - `MaxPooling2D`
  - `AveragePooling2D`
  - `BatchNorm`
  - `Dropout`
  - `Flatten`
  - `Add`
  - `Concatenate`
- Activations:
  - `Linear`
  - `Sigmoid`
  - `Tanh`
  - `ReLU`
  - `LeakyReLU`
  - `ELU`
  - `Softmax`
- Losses
  - `BinaryCrossEntropy`
  - `CategoricalCrossEntropy`
  - `MeanSquaredError`
- Optimizers:
  - Vanilla `SGD`
  - `SGD` with momentum
  - `RMSProp`
  - Vanilla `Adam`
  - `Adam` with AMSGrad.
- Learning Rate Decay
  - `TimeDecay`
  - `ExponentialDecay`
  - `CosineDecay`

It is also possible to easily add layers, activations, losses, optimizers and decay algorithms.

**Note**: There is no automatic differentiation. Users, when extending, need to define the necessary derivatives for backpropagation.

Hope you like it! Happy learning!
